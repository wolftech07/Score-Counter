# Score-Counter

Simple manual score-keeping web app for FIRST-style matches.

Usage
 - Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser (or run a local static server).
 - Add scoring categories (name + point value).
 - Tap + / - under each alliance to update counts. Totals update automatically.
 - Use Export CSV to download results, or Print for a paper copy.

Data is saved to your browser's `localStorage` so it persists between visits.

Files
 - index.html — main UI
 - styles.css — styling
 - script.js — app logic (localStorage, counts, export)

Want changes? Tell me which scoring rules or layout you prefer and I can adapt the UI.
